## Current & Future Plans

**2025 Season is underway!** This means new datasets are presented and updated over time, especially when grands prix are completed this season.

At last, I finally published the **2024 Season analyses** and is now accessible! The next thing is to prepare the **2023 Season analyses** in the most reasonable time possible.

Meanwhile, although not carried out yet, the older season analyses might be revised for improved visuals.

Besides, there exist all race results of 2013-2018 seasons right now, contained in a separate folder and retroactively more previous seasons will be uploaded some time.
