Hello everyone! You are viewing my repository, dedicated to **Formula 1 World Championship** which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As an experienced data scientist and have been following F1 for over two decades, I have high-level of passion to make datasets and enable analyses on drivers & teams with regards to their race results, qualifying results, plus other sessions throughout the seasons.

## Source

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/), plus EA & Codemasters F1 Games for driver ratings [here](https://www.ea.com/games/f1/driver-ratings?isLocalized=true).

## IMPORTANT!

## Current & Future Plans

**2025 Season is underway!** This means new datasets are presented and updated over time, especially when grands prix are completed this season.

Concurrently, my objective is to publish **2023 & 2024 Season analyses** at any time, thus these two will be published when they are fully prepared.

Meanwhile, although not carried out yet, the older season analyses might be revised for improved visuals.

Besides, there exist all race results of 2013-2018 seasons right now, contained in a separate folder and retroactively more previous seasons will be uploaded some time.
